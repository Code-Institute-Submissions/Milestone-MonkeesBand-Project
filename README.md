     Milestone Project - Monkees band fan site.
     
     UX
     ___
    
     I designed the website for fans/followers of the Monkees to promote the bands music and availability for bookings to play live.
     As the band is based from 1960's I wanted to make it as user friendly as possible with a simple navigation bar that could direct the user
     clearly through the site. I drew up basic wireframes to give me an idea of what I wanted the site to look like before I started writing any code.
     These files can be found  in a seperate directory named "assets/wireframes" embedded in my project.
     
     Features
     _________
     
     My website consists of four different pages named home, media, gigs and bookings. I obtained the audio and image material 
     provided for the project via github and implemented them across the site. The link for the material used is, 
     https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets/tree/master/stream-1/band-assets. 
     
     1. index.html: The home page gives the user information about the band members and includes images of each individual band member. 
     
     2.Page two (media) provides four different audio files and a
     video file to give examples of the bands music. Page three (gigs) is used for promotion of the band telling the user what type of 
     events or functions the band is available to play at and a brief list of their own future gigs. Finally page four includes a mock up submit form 
     where the user could theoretically book the monkees to play.
     
     Technologies Used

     To achieve this task I used two languages HTML and CSS. I also used libraries obtained via Bootstrap to help with the layout and styles on
     my page.
     
     Links to libraries used;
     
     "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
     "https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
     
     Testing
     ________
     
     As it is only a mock up website there is not much testing needed to be done but I have fully tested that the navigation bar and the submit form
     are functioning. 
     
     e.g
     
     1. Submit form:
     
     i. Go to "bookings" page.
     ii. If you try to submit an empty form or it with missing spaces and a valid error message will appear.
     iii. Try to submit the form with an invalid email adress and the correct error message will be given.
